        <b>Heterogeneous Treatment Effects of Intensive Blood Pressure Control on Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events in Nondiabetic Patients </b>

        Socioeconomically disadvantaged populations face a higher risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), a
        leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Thus, it is important to address these risks
        effectively to reduce health disparities. While blood pressure (BP) control is a crucial strategy to reduce
        CVD risk, the uniformity of treatment effects from intensive BP control and BP-lowering medications
        across different patient subpopulations—each with unique medical histories, biomarkers, and
        socioeconomic statuses—remains unclear. Hypothesizing these treatment effects may vary across
        subpopulations, we aim to seek the subgroup with the most benefit by identifying key modifiers
        contributing to this heterogeneity. Using data from the Systolic blood PRessure INtervention Trial, we
        focused on the time to the first major adverse cardiovascular events as our outcome, which includes CVD
        death, fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-MI acute coronary syndrome, fatal or non-fatal stroke,
        and fatal or non-fatal heart failure. The intervention of interest is an intensive BP control strategy
        targeting a systolic BP of less than 120 mmHg. We employed advanced machine-learning techniques
        such as causal survival forests for model training and Shapley Additive exPlanations values for
        interpretation, where the identified key modifiers include biomarkers related to metabolic, lipid
        metabolic, renal, electrolyte, and cardiovascular function, as well as cognitive assessment measures, and
        general health and physical measurements. Finally, we found the heterogeneities in hazard ratios across
        subgroups defined by these key modifiers, using the Cox proportional hazards model. <br><br>

        (SPRINT), heterogeneous treatment effects, causal survival forests, Cox proportional hazards model,
        health disparities.

        <b>1. Identifying Novel Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) Subgroups among the General US Population: A Machine Learning Approach </b>

        An increasing emphasis has been placed on addressing social determinants of health (SDOH) through clinical and policy-level
        interventions. However, SDOH encompasses a wide range of intercorrelated social constructs, and these needs often have deeper roots 
        and correlations with one another. This complexity poses significant challenges in designing effective and targeted screening and 
        intervention strategies. This study aims to leverage advanced machine learning algorithms to cluster the US population into subgroups with
        distinctive SDOH characteristics, providing valuable insights into the intricate landscape of SDOH needs. 
        Survey data on 266 individual-level SDOH variables, linked with electronic health records from 28,778
        participants of the All of Us research program, was utilized. A stepwise clustering approach was employed, using the partitioning around medoids (PAM) alg
        orithm with the Calinski-Harabasz (CH) index for initial feature selection. PAM was then reapplied to the selected key features 
        to determine the final clusters. Each cluster was labeled based on its distinctive characteristics, and we examined whether these SDOH 
        clusters exhibited unique disease profiles, including the prevalence of type 2 diabetes, obesity, and a history of pneumonia.
        Clustering pre-retirees (45-64) and elderly (65+) participants revealed five and eight distinct SDOH groups, respectively. 
        Several key variables were common among both pre-retirees and the elderly, including labor market activity, affordability of medical care, 
        and smoking behavior. For pre-retirees, additional factors strongly influenced clustering into different SDOH groups in cluded
        annual household income, highest degree in education, neighborhood safety and their income, negative experience in healthcare and 
        healthcare coverage, ethnicity, marital status, sexual orientation, presence of supportive relationships, and religiousness. For the elderly,
        neighbors' attentiveness to home maintenance, frequency of relocation, healthcare utilization rates, cultural preferences for healthcare 
        providers, insurance coverage, and experiences of disrespect emerged as pivotal variables, marking a noteworthy shift in SDOH from pre-retiree to retired.
        Clusters characterized by higher SDOH statuses exhibited a significantly lower prevalence of type 2 diabetes, current obesity, and a 
        history of pneumonia. Findings can inform the development of targeted SDOH screening and interventions.

        <b>2. Specification and Estimation of Spatial Interaction Models for Nonnegative Origin-destination Flows </b>

        The gravity equation has a long-standing empirical tradition in estimating international trade flows. Despite its
        widespread use, the traditional gravity model for Origin-Destination (OD) flows has significant limitations. First, it
        accounts only for bilateral interactions, lacking a broader multilateral context that includes multilateral resistance
        and third-party effects. Second, the log-transformed specification for outcomes may lead to invalid inferences. Therefore, we advocate for the use of outcome data in its original level form, while incorporating multilateral resistance
        and spillover effects. We propose a novel spatial interaction model for nonnegative OD flows, integrating spatial
        weighting matrices and additive fixed effects into the Poisson maximum likelihood estimation. Additionally, we adjust standard errors to ensure robustness against heteroscedasticity and correlated errors. Monte Carlo simulations
        demonstrate favorable finite sample properties of our estimator. Finally, an empirical application using trade data
        provides strong evidence of spillover effects resulting from multilateral interactions based on geographic, economic,
        and political proximities. <br><br>
        <b>Keywords:</b> Origin-destination (OD) flows, gravity equation, third-party effects, log transformation, multilateral
resistance, Poisson pseudo maximum likelihood estimation.
